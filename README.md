# Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification

This version of the course is being taught at Purdue University during Spring 2016.
The code for the course is ME 59700.
The instructors are Prof. [Ilias Bilionis](http://www.predictivesciencelab.org/people.html) and
Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/).
The class meets every Tuesday and Thursday 1:30pm-2:45pm at ME 3021.

The goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of uncertainty quantification to advanced undergraduates or graduate engineering and science students with research interests in the field of predictive modeling. Upon completion of this course the students should be able to:

+ Represent mathematically the uncertainty in the parameters of physical models.
+ Propagate parametric uncertainty through physical models to quantify the induced uncertainty on quantities of interest.
+ Calibrate the uncertain parameters of physical models using experimental data.
+ Combine multiple sources of information to enhance the predictive capabilities of models.
+ Pose and solve design optimization problems under uncertainty involving expensive computer simulations.

## Installation of Required Software for Viewing the Notebookes

### Microsoft Windows

+ Install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com). We need it for compiling stuff on windows. While the setup runs, we need to select a few packages for installation. These are:
    + Devel->gcc-core
    + Devel->gcc-fortran
    + Devel->gcc-g++
    + Devel->git
Say, "yes" to the installation of the dependencies.

+ Download Anaconda for Linux (Python 2.7). Make sure you know where you save the file.
+ In the Cygwin command line, type (adjusted properly):
```
bash /cygdrive/c/Users/<Windows User Name>/Downloads/Anaconda2-2.4.1-linux-x86_64.sh
```
and follow the instructions. Note that, the filename of the ``Anaconda*.sh`` file may be different in your case.

### Apple OS X

+ [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics, is absolutely essential to group the installation of many packages.

### Linux

+ [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics, is absolutely essential to group the installation of many packages.

+ A working latex distribution. We suggest [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/) for OS X users, and [MikTex](http://miktex.org) for Windows users.

+ [Jupyter Notebook Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions)
is required to properly display latex in the document (bibliography and equation numbers).

+ Essential UQ software developed by the [Predictive Science Laboratory](http://www.predictivesciencelab.org):
    
    + [py-orthpol](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/py-orthpol) for generating orthogonal polynomials with respect to arbitrary probability measures. Requires FORTRAN compiler.
    
    + [py-design](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/py-design) for generating designs for computer codes. Requires FORTRAN compiler.

+ [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE.git) is required only if you want to view the presentation as slides.
